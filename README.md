## About nand2tetris

nand2tetris is a beautiful, free course that shows you how to build a computer from scratch. 
Along the way, you get to learn about a lot of the building blocks of computers, and computer
science - logic gates, compilers, assemblers, and finally how high level languages are built.

You can follow the original course [here](http://www.nand2tetris.org/) and the (easier to follow) 
Coursera version [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/)

These are my solutions to the exercises in the course. If you are following it, I encourage to 
find your own solutions and only use mine to contrast with them. There's plenty of other sets
 of solutions out there that you can also look at
